#This will be where the intial code lives#  
	
#To load in an excel sheet, you will need to install and load in a few packages. We will also load in some other packages we will be using for analysis and visualization later on. 
You can use the c() function to list out all the packages you want to install at once but can not do that with library() so we create a vector to use lapply() to solve this!#

`install.packages(c("data.table", "readxl", "ggplot2", "dplyr")`
`packages <- c('ggplot2', 'data.table', 'readxl', 'dplyr')`
`lapply(some_packages, library, character.only=TRUE)`

#Next, we will grab the EMS Weekly data collection and name it "EMS_test"#

 `EMS_test <- as.data.table(read_excel("~/Data_24/EMS_Tableau_Weekly.xlsx", sheet = "EMS_Tableau_Weekly"))`

#Loading in CSV files is a bit easier but for excel, you will need to know the name of each sheet you are pulling in. For this example, there is only one!#
